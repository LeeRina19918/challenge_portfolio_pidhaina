# Task 1: Software Configuration
### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hello! My name is Iryna, and I set myself the goal of changing my profession. I love technology very much, and therefore I have always been interested in more and more complex processes that I can accomplish with its help.

I saw this Challenger on Instagram and immediately decided to register. I see it as an opportunity to gain new knowledge in testing, and my goal is to work in the IT field. A modern profession in a progressive field will help me to be in good shape all the time.

#### Sincerely,
#### Iryna.
